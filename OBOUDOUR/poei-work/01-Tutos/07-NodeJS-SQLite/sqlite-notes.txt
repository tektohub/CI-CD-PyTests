SQLite AUTOINCREMENT column attribute

SQLite recommends that you should not use AUTOINCREMENT attribute because:

    The AUTOINCREMENT keyword imposes extra CPU, memory, disk space, and disk I/O overhead and should be avoided if not strictly needed. It is usually not needed.

In addition, the way SQLite assigns a value for the AUTOINCREMENT column slightly different from the way it does for the rowid column.

When should you use the AUTOINCREMENT column attribute?

The main purpose of using attribute AUTOINCREMENT is to prevent SQLite to reuse a value that has not been used or a value from the previously deleted row.

If you don’t have any requirement like this, you should not use the AUTOINCREMENT attribute in the primary key.
