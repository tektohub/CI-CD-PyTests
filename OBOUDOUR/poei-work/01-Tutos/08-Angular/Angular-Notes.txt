Hosting an Angular app on Firebase

One of the easiest ways to get your site live is to host it using Firebase.

    Sign up for a firebase account on Firebase.
    Create a new project, giving it any name you like.
    Install the firebase-tools CLI that will handle your deployment using npm install -g firebase-tools.
    Connect your CLI to your Firebase account and initialize the connection to your project using firebase login and firebase init.
    Follow the prompts to select the Firebase project you are creating for hosting.

    Select the Hosting option on the first prompt.
    Select the project you previously created on Firebase.
    Select dist/my-project-name as the public directory.

    Deploy your application with firebase deploy, because the command firebase init has created a firebase.json file that tells Firebase how to serve your app.
    Once deployed, visit https://your-firebase-project-name.firebaseapp.com to see it live!

Hosting an Angular app anywhere else
To host an Angular app on another web host, you'll need to upload or send the files to the host. Because you are building a Single Page Application, you'll also need to make sure you redirect any invalid URLs to your index.html file. Learn more about development and distribution of your application in the Building & Serving and Deployment guides.
